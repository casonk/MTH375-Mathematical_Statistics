(a) The form of the UMP test of the hypotheses $ H_{0} : \theta = \theta_{0} $ vs. $ H_{A} : \theta > \theta_{0} $. \\
\vspace{2.5mm} \\
\textit{Solution}:
\vspace{2.5mm} \\

\noindent
I will first state the general form then elaborate on the requested solution. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \ds f(x; \theta) = \frac{1}{\theta} e^{-x/\theta} $.
    \item $ \ds \frac{L(\theta_{0})}{L(\theta_{A})} = \Bigl( \frac{\theta_{A}}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr)^{n} e^{\ds \Sigma_{X} \Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr)} < k $.
    \item $ \ds \Sigma_{X} \Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) < \ln(k) - n\ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{A}}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) $.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Thus if $ \theta_{A} > \theta_{0} $, our form is $ \Sigma_{X} > k_{\alpha} $ as $ \ds \Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) < 0 $. \\

(b) The form of the UMP test of the hypotheses $ H_{0} : \theta = \theta_{0} $ vs. $ H_{A} : \theta < \theta_{0} $. \\

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
Thus if $ \theta_{A} < \theta_{0} $, our form is ``Reject $ H_{0} $ if $ \Sigma_{X} < k_{\alpha} $'' as $ \ds \Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) > 0 $. \\

(a) The form of the UMP test of the hypotheses $ H_{0} : \theta = 0.6 $ vs. $ H_{A} : \theta < 0.6 $. \\
\vspace{2.5mm} \\
\textit{Solution}:
\vspace{2.5mm} \\

\noindent
I will first state the general form then elaborate on the requested solution. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \ds f(x; \theta) = \binom{1}{x} \theta^{x} (1 - \theta)^{1 - x} $.
    \item $ \ds \frac{L(\theta_{0})}{L(\theta_{A})} = \Bigl( \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta_{A}} \Bigr)^{\ds \Sigma_{x}} \Bigl( \frac{1 - \theta_{0}}{1 -\theta_{A}} \Bigr)^{\ds n - \Sigma_{x}} < k $.
    \item $ \ds \Sigma_{X} \ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta_{A}} \Bigr) + (n - \Sigma_{x})\ln\Bigl( \frac{1 - \theta_{0}}{1 -\theta_{A}} \Bigr)  < \ln(k) $.
    \item $ \ds \Sigma_{X} \Biggl( \ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta_{A}} \Bigr) - \ln\Bigl( \frac{1 - \theta_{0}}{1 -\theta_{A}} \Bigr) \Biggr) < \ln(k) - n\ln\Bigl( \frac{1 - \theta_{0}}{1 -\theta_{A}} \Bigr) $.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Thus if $ \theta_{A} < \theta_{0} $, our form is ``Reject $ H_{0} $ if $ \Sigma_{X} < k_{\alpha} $'' as $ \ds \ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta_{A}} \Bigr) > \ln\Bigl( \frac{1 - \theta_{0}}{1 -\theta_{A}} \Bigr) $. \\

(b) The UMP test at level of significance $ \alpha = 0.05 $. \\
\vspace{2.5mm} \\
\textit{Solution}:
\vspace{2.5mm} \\

\noindent
Our goal is to find $ k_{\alpha} $. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item As $ X_{i} \sim Binomial(1, \theta) $, $ \Sigma_{X} \sim Binomial(n, \theta) $.
    \item $ \ds k_{\alpha} = {\XBB \texttt{qbinom(size = $ n $, prob = $ \theta $, p = $ \alpha $)}} $.
    \item $ \ds {\XBB \texttt{qbinom(size = 10, prob = 0.6, p = 0.05)}} = 3 = k_{0.05} $.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Our test is thus ``Reject $ H_{0} $ if $ \Sigma_{X} < 3 $.'' \\

(a) The form of the UMP test of the hypotheses $ H_{0} : \theta = 5 $ vs. $ H_{A} : \theta < 5 $. \\
\vspace{2.5mm} \\
\textit{Solution}:
\vspace{2.5mm} \\ 

\noindent
I will first state the general form then elaborate on the requested solution. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \ds f(x; \theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\theta}} e^{\ds -\frac{x^{2}}{2\theta}} $.
    \item $ \ds \frac{L(\theta_{0})}{L(\theta_{A})} = \Bigl( \frac{\theta_{A}}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr)^{\ds n/2} e^{\ds -\frac{\Sigma_{X^{2}}}{2}\Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} \Bigr)} < k $.
    \item $ \ds \frac{n}{2}\ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{A}}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) + \frac{\Sigma_{X^{2}}}{2}\Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) < \ln(k) $.
    \item $ \ds \Sigma_{X^{2}}\Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) < 2\ln(k) - n\ln\Bigl( \frac{\theta_{A}}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) $.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Thus if $ \theta_{A} < \theta_{0} $, our form is ``Reject $ H_{0} $ if $ \Sigma_{X^{2}} < k_{\alpha} $'' as $ \ds \Bigl( \frac{1}{\theta_{A}} - \frac{1}{\theta_{0}} \Bigr) > 0 $. \\

\textit{Solution}:
\vspace{2.5mm} \\

\noindent
Our goal is to find $ k_{\alpha} $. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item As $ X_{i} \sim Normal(\mu=0, \sigma^{2}=\theta) $, $\ds \frac{\Sigma_{X^{2}}}{\theta} \sim \chi^{2}_{n} $.
    \item $ \ds k_{\alpha} = {\XBB \theta \cdot \texttt{qchisq(df = $ n $, p = $ \alpha $)}} $.

Our test is thus ``Reject $ H_{0} $ if $ \Sigma_{X^{2}} < 12.79 $.'' \\
